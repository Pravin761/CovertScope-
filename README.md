# CovertScope-
CovertScope is a Python-based tool for generating, analyzing, and decoding synthetic covert channel signals using OOK, PWM, and Manchester encoding schemes.

Features

- Bitstream signal generation
- OOK / Manchester / PWM encoding
- Noise simulation (Gaussian)
- Frequency analysis (PSD, dominant frequency)
- BER calculation & signal decoding
- Visualization (waveform, decoded bits, PSD)
- Batch testing & noise sweep comparison
